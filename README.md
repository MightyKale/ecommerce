This is the first responsive ecommerce full stack website I built using React following a tutorial video from [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mOkFXyxfsU).

On this website, you are able to:
- add and edit products in cart with **Sanity**
- see recommended products while in a product page
- checkout with **Stripe**
